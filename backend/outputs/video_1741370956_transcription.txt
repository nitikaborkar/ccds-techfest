What if I told you, dog food has more protein than whey protein? Let's test it. Hi, what's your highest protein pet food? Dog food? So we've got pedigree dog food, bruised dog food. This packet just costed me 10 rupees. As you can see, 24% of protein. So that's 9.6 grams of protein in this packet. Let's test it out. Smells like regret. This tastes worse than hostel food. Yeah, I know. I'm going to stick to chicken breast and whey protein. At least the leftovers didn't go to waste. The stray dogs got a proper meal and that's all that matters.
