This is the amount of body fat that you would lose per day in a 250 calorie deficit. It's barely anything and it's unrecognizable, especially because in the same day your body would have retained some water. So the weight of this bowl is going to be primarily water and not body fat. Then the next day, if you stay consistent, you would lose the same amount. But then again, you'd also have similar changes in water retention. This cycle will basically continue with every single day that you're in a calorie deficit. You see different changes in water retention. So after a week you might weigh yourself and nothing is recognizable. The weight has stayed the same, you're a little bit frustrated, but you have dropped half a pound of body fat. This is where you need to understand that losing fat and losing weight are two different things. If you're in a calorie deficit, it's going to be inevitable that you are going to drop body fat. It's impossible not to. But the water retention is always going to be all over the place. You don't really have much control over this. That's why when it comes to losing body fat, you can't just go off a weekly scale reading. Because to be honest, it doesn't really show you that much. Remember that you lose a minuscule amount of body fat per day. It comes out to about 0.64 grams of fat that you would lose a day. You can see changes in water up to two kilograms. That's a huge difference. So you could be losing body fat, but the scale weight goes up. I know sometimes that's so hard to understand because the likes of Slimming World has led you to believe that you're only making successful fat loss if the scale weight is going down. That's why you need other measurements of progress in place like taking photos, doing measurements, going off how your clothes fit, generally going off how you feel. These will show you much more than what this would.
