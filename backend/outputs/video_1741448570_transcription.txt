What's better, a regular coke with 30 grams of sugar, or this diet coke with artificial sweetener? Well, studies show the artificial sweetener aspartame, which makes this sweet, may cause cancer. But here's what you don't know. You see, aspartame is a group 2B carcinogen, which means there's no proof that it can cause cancer in humans. And to cross the daily safe intake of aspartame as recommended by the WHO, a 70kg adult would have to drink 17 cans of diet coke every day. Well, if you're drinking this much diet coke, well then the problem is not aspartame. So if replacing sugary drink with a zero-calorie alternative helps you stay in shape, that's a win.
