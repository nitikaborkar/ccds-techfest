The review highlights the need for further studies and clinical trials to establish the efficacy of these compounds in cancer treatment.\n\nWhile turmeric may have properties that could be beneficial in cancer treatment, the evidence presented does not support the claim that it cures cancer outright. The lack of definitive scientific backing for the claim indicates that it should be approached with caution.",
