Without this information, we cannot confirm that 24% protein translates to 9.6 grams.\n\nThe evidence suggests that treat labeling often expresses ingredients in non-specific categories, and the study does not confirm the protein content claimed. Therefore, the claim about the specific protein percentage and amount in grams is unsupported.",
