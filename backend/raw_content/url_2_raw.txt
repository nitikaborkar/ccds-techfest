The claim that 'Type 1 Diabetes Is Associated with Insulin Resistance and Beta-Cell Dysfunction' is refuted by the article "Insulin Resistance, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes, and Related Complications 2017" on PMC. \n\n**Explanation**:  \nType 1 diabetes is described as being primarily caused by an autoimmune-induced destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin deficiencyâ€”without a mention of insulin resistance as a primary feature. On the other hand, Type 2 diabetes is clearly associated with peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. \n\n**Scientific Evidence**:  \nThe article specifies: \n- Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune-mediated beta-cell destruction, leading to an absence of insulin production. \n- Type 2 diabetes involves a combination of insulin resistance and dysfunctional pancreatic beta-cell secretion. \n\n**Rating**: \nI rate the claim a 2/10 for accuracy because it inaccurately represents the key pathophysiological traits of Type 1 diabetes.  \n\n**Counter Argument**: \nThe central distinction outlined is that while beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance are indeed hallmarks of Type 2 diabetes, Type 1 diabetes involves autoimmune beta-cell destruction without inherent insulin resistance."
