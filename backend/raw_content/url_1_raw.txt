        "scientific_evidence": "The study analyzed 41 dog treats and provided information on their nutrient composition, but it did not specify that any of the treats contained 24% protein or that a specific packet contained 9.6 grams of protein.",
        "counter_claim": "The evidence suggests that treat labeling often expresses ingredients in non-specific categories, and the study does not confirm the protein content claimed. Therefore, the claim about the specific protein percentage and amount in grams is unsupported.",
