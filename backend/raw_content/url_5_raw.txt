        "scientific_evidence": "The review discusses various bioactive compounds in turmeric, particularly curcuminoids and non-curcuminoids, and their potential anticancer properties. It highlights that curcuminoids have been extensively studied for their anticancer activities, while non-curcuminoids also exhibit significant anticancer effects. The evidence presented indicates that turmeric and its components are being researched for their therapeutic potential against cancer, rather than causing it.",
        "counter_claim": "The evidence contradicts the claim that turmeric causes cancer, as it emphasizes the anticancer properties of turmeric's bioactive compounds. The review suggests that turmeric has been used in traditional medicine for its health benefits, including cancer prevention, rather than being associated with cancer causation.",
