It highlights that there is little epidemiologic information on the effects of turmeric consumption, suggesting that turmeric may help alleviate disease burden through prevention rather than causing cancer.",
        "counter_claim": "The evidence presented in the article indicates that turmeric, particularly curcumin, is being researched for its potential benefits in cancer therapy, rather than being associated with causing cancer. This contradicts the claim that turmeric causes cancer.",
