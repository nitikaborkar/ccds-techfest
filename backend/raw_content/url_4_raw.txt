        "scientific_evidence": "The study indicates that the choice of zero-calorie beverages is influenced by health consciousness and social media dynamics, suggesting that while these drinks are perceived as healthier, they are also viewed as artificial products. This ambivalence reflects a complex relationship with health and identity, rather than a straightforward benefit of replacing sugary drinks with zero-calorie options.",

This indicates that simply replacing sugary drinks with zero-calorie alternatives may not lead to the expected health benefits, as consumers may still struggle with health perceptions and the implications of consuming artificial products.",
