The article from PMC supports the claim that Type 1 Diabetes is associated with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Scientific evidence includes:

1. Increasing incidence of insulin resistance in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
2. Shared complications between T1D and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), such as cardiomyopathy, are typically linked to insulin resistance.
3. Factors like oxidative stress and inflammation contributing to insulin resistance even in T1D.
4. Recognition of high levels of advanced glycation end products due to hyperglycemia, leading to insulin signaling deregulation, which indicates beta-cell dysfunction.

Given these points, the claim is rated 8/10 for accuracy, as it reflects both traditional insights and emerging evidence regarding insulin resistance in T1D. The detailed evaluation and rating are based solely on the article's content.
