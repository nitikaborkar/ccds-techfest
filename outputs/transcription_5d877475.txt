Today, I'm testing if KFC's paneer zinger burger actually has real paneer or if it's fake. Let's find out. Here's what real paneer looks like. I'm pouring iodine on it and as you can see, the colour stays the same. And when fake paneer reacts to iodine, it turns purple black like this. Keep that in mind as we test the paneer zinger from KFC. Moment of truth. What the fuck, it's fake. Oh, look at that. See how it turned purple? That's not normal. This is fake paneer. This is what you're eating? Fake paneer. There's no way I'm having this burger. KFC sells fake paneer. If you're having paneer from there, run.
